KFCinema is a collaborative project undertaken by four contributors: Ivan, Nikita, Aleks, and Kelly 
over the course of seven months, starting in September. The main goal of the project is to develop a fully functional cinema website.
For our concept, we chose to create a KFC-themed cinema platform, inspired by our shared love for KFC.

Throughout this project, we aim not only to build a professional-quality web application but also to enhance our skills in key areas such as backend and frontend development,
testing, databases, UI/UX design, and more. This will also be a valuable opportunity to strengthen our teamwork and collaboration abilities.
